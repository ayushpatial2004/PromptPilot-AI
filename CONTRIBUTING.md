# Contributing to PromptPilot-AI

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document explains how to set up the project locally, how to work with branches, and how to submit a pull request.

## Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bindu2020324/PromptPilot-AI.git
   cd PromptPilot-AI
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. Load the extension into Chrome/Edge:
   - Open `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/`
   - Enable **Developer mode**
   - Click **Load unpacked**
   - Select the generated `dist/` folder

## Coding & Styling Conventions

- **Linting**: Ensure all code passes ESLint rules. Run `npm run lint`.
- **Formatting**: Format your code using Prettier before committing: `npm run format`.
- **Testing**: Run unit tests to verify the code behaves as expected: `npm run test`.
- **Coverage**: Maintain test coverage for new business logic.

## Commit Message Conventions

This project enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) via `commitlint`. Each commit message must follow this format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Commit Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process, dependencies, or tooling
- `ci`: Changes to CI/CD configuration
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

### Commit Rules

- Subject line must be lowercase
- Subject line must not exceed 100 characters
- Subject line must not end with a period
- Subject line should be imperative (use "add" not "added" or "adds")
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Wrap body at 100 characters

### Good Commit Examples

```
feat: add prompt export functionality to sidebar menu
```

```
fix(popup): make responsive across different screen sizes

- Updated CSS breakpoints for mobile devices
- Adjusted font sizes and padding for smaller screens
- Tested on iPhone and Android devices
```

```
docs: update installation instructions for Node.js 18+
```

```
refactor: simplify prompt caching logic

Previously used conditional statements for checking cache validity.
Now uses optional chaining for cleaner, more readable code.
```

```
test: add unit tests for prompt history export utilities
```

### Bad Commit Examples

```
✗ Updated stuff
✗ Fix bug
✗ Added new features
✗ feat: Added prompt export functionality to sidebar menu.
✗ feat: Add prompt export functionality to sidebar menu that allows users to export their prompt history in JSON format and also supports CSV export
✗ FEAT: ADD PROMPT EXPORT
```

## Development Workflow

### Run in watch mode

To build and watch for changes locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then refresh the loaded unpacked extension page after changes.

## Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names based on the type of work:

- `feature/<short-description>` for new features
- `fix/<short-description>` for bug fixes
- `docs/<short-description>` for documentation updates
- `chore/<short-description>` for maintenance tasks

Examples:
- `feature/add-extension-options`
- `fix/popup-rendering-issue`
- `docs/add-contributing-guidelines`

## Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting a PR, make sure to:

- [ ] Fork the repository and create a new branch
- [ ] Install dependencies and build the project
- [ ] Verify the extension loads in the browser from `dist/`
- [ ] Confirm the change works and does not break existing behavior
- [ ] Add or update documentation if needed
- [ ] Run linter and formatter validation locally
- [ ] Provide a clear PR description and link any related issue
- [ ] Keep changes focused to a single task when possible

## Testing the Extension

To test the unpacked extension in Chrome/Edge:

1. Build the project with `npm run build`
2. Open the browser extension page:
   - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
   - Edge: `edge://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer mode**
4. Click **Load unpacked**
5. Choose the `dist/` folder created by the build
6. Reload the extension after making code changes

## Reporting Issues

Please open a GitHub issue for:

- bugs or unexpected behavior
- feature requests
- documentation improvements
- compatibility issues

If you can, include:

- steps to reproduce
- expected behavior
- actual behavior
- browser and OS details

## Notes

- Node.js 14+ is required
- Use `npm run build` when preparing a PR
- For rapid changes, `npm run dev` is helpful, but the browser still needs the latest `dist/` build loaded
