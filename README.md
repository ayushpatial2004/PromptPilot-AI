## ⚡ Cache-Optimized 3-Layer Prompt Pipeline

Built-in reference for **Gemini Prompt Caching**. The main UI surfaces a collapsible section that explains the three prompt layers and ships a one-click **"Copy Production Python Code"** button:

- **L1 — Static System Instructions** (Fully Cacheable): persona, output contract, scoring rubric.
- **L2 — Developer Rules** (Cacheable): domain frameworks and mode overlays.
- **L3 — Dynamic User Input** (Non-Cacheable): the user's prompt plus attachments.

A drop-in Python implementation using the official `google-genai` SDK lives at [`caching_pipeline.py`](caching_pipeline.py). Source-of-truth contents are defined in [`src/config/cachingPipeline.js`](src/config/cachingPipeline.js) and rendered by [`src/components/CachingPipeline.jsx`](src/components/CachingPipeline.jsx).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
- API key from Groq, Gemini, or OpenAI (see [API Setup Guide](#-api-setup-guide) above)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bindu2020324/PromptPilot-AI.git
   cd PromptPilot-AI
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Running from a shared ZIP

If you send someone the ZIP file, they must follow these steps:

1. unzip the project folder
2. open a terminal in the project folder
3. run `npm install`
4. run `npm run build`
5. load the extension from the generated `dist/` folder in the browser

### If you want the ZIP to work without requiring npm install

1. build the project locally first:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
2. include the entire `dist/` folder in the ZIP
3. the recipient can then load the unpacked extension directly from `dist/`

### Loading the built extension

1. Open your browser extension page:
   - Chrome/Edge: `chrome://extensions/`
   - Firefox: `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
2. Enable **Developer Mode** (Chrome/Edge)
3. Click **Load unpacked** and choose the `dist/` folder

### Free GitHub-built version

If your repository is public, this project automatically builds on every push to `main` and uploads a ready-to-download `dist` artifact.

To use it:

1. Open your repository on GitHub
2. Go to **Actions**
3. Open the latest `Build and package extension` workflow run
4. Download the `promptpilot-ai-dist` artifact
5. Unzip and load the `dist/` folder as an unpacked extension

This gives users a simple free way to try the extension without running `npm install` or `npm run build` themselves.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter runtime, build, installation, or environment issues, start with the troubleshooting guide:

- [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting.md)

---

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and watch for changes.

### Loading the Extension

1. Open your browser and go to the extensions page:
   - **Chrome/Edge**: `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/`
   - **Firefox**: `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`

2. Enable **Developer Mode** (top-right corner for Chrome/Edge)

3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `dist` folder from your project

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized build in the `dist` folder ready for distribution.

### Code Quality

```bash
npm run lint        # Check for ESLint errors
npm run format      # Auto-format code with Prettier
npm run format:check # Check formatting without changing files
```
